# What's Hippodrome? 
Hippodrome is a project built during Base Buidlathon, currently deployed on base sepolia. The platform is intended to be used by Founders that need to launch their own token during a campaign to raise interest and funds.
Hippodrome is built on base sepolia and integrates Synthetix V3 and Aerodrome 

## The protocol
# General purpose
Users can support a project by sending USDC to Hippodrome. Hippodrome then deposit these tokens on the campaign associated Account on Synthetix, thus delegating the funds to a pool that return a % APR.
The value generated by USDC is then used when the campaign is over in order to create a liquidity pool newToken/USDC on Aerodrome.
According to the vesting settings the user will be able to get his rewards.

The goal is having a way for supportes to contribute via revenue to create a starting point for the Pool to start existing.
The vesting period serves as tool to avoid supporters dumps, therefore giving time to the secondary market to go in price discovery.

This model serves a way to give plenty of time to the users to join a campaign and give equal change to acquire token at the same price, the cost is time/usdc deposited.

## The Founder
The creator can create a campaign filling a form in which he can set:
  - Token address of his token
  - Time range of the campaign
  - Time range of the unvesting ( which is in form of a stream )
  - Allocate an amount of tokens destined as countervalue for the Pool 
  - Allocate an amount of tokens destined for the rewards pool.
## The Supporter
An user can support a campaign by staking USDC. These USDC are forwarded into a Synthetix account to generate APR. He can then withdraw this amount at any time.
When the campaign is resolved he will be able to:
  - Get back his current USDC stake
  - Get his reward tokens based on his contribution and what's available at a given time in the stream
  
## The stack
Synthetix V3 serves a a way for the protocol to raise funds
Aerodrome is used to create a pool once the campaign is over

## The deployment
Hippodrome is live on base sepolia at:

[Hippodrome - Sepolia Base Scan](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x823893f612fbca134919014b1330e001ab0be664)

You can test the application by acquiring fUSDC needed for Synthetix to work at:

[Vyper Token Faucet Helper](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xa1ae612e07511a947783c629295678c07748bc7a#writeContract#F1)

You can write directly via explorer the function deposit_eth 
Set some eth as amount and fUSDC as token address

fUSDC address is 0xc43708f8987Df3f3681801e5e640667D86Ce3C30
